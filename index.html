            <h1>Building <i>The Maze</i>: My Journey into 3D Game Engine Development</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a 3D game engine from scratch has always been a dream of mine. Combining my passion for game development with a desire to master fundamental 3D rendering techniques, I embarked on building <i>The Maze</i>, a 3D game engine that uses raycasting to simulate a 3D environment. In this blog post, I’ll take you through the journey of how I designed, developed, and optimized <i>The Maze</i>—a project that showcases my skills in SDL2, C++, and 3D graphics programming.

                <h2>Inspiration Behind <i>The Maze</i></h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for <i>The Maze</i> stems from classic games like <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> and <i>DOOM</i>, which used raycasting to create immersive 3D worlds using 2D maps. I wanted to replicate the charm of those games while adding my twist: random maze generation, texture mapping, and modern user input controls.

            <section id="project-overview">
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Raycasting Rendering:</strong> A 2D map is rendered as a 3D environment using raycasting techniques.</li>
                    <li><strong>Texture Mapping:</strong> Textures are applied to walls for a more immersive visual experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera and Player Movement:</strong> Players can move and rotate their viewpoint, providing a sense of exploration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Ensures that players can't pass through walls, adding realism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Random Maze Generation:</strong> Every playthrough features a new, procedurally generated maze layout.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was implementing texture mapping efficiently. Balancing texture quality with performance required a lot of tweaking and optimization. Additionally, collision detection had to be fine-tuned to ensure smooth movement without glitches.
